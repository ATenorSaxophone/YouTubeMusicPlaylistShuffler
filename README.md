Built a Java applicaiton that utilizes the YouTube Data API to generate a 
shuffled music playlist from other playlists the user has selected.

This project was made to help me get hands-on experience with RESTful APIs and 
OAuth authentication. It also helped me gain knowledge on JSON data and data 
parsing. With all the knowledge I learned, I was able to create a working version
of the YouTube playlist music shuffler.

Only a portion of the code has been uploaded.
